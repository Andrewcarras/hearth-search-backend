## Search Details

### Query Information
- **Query ID**: `28ef18aa-a927-48df-9933-31f85d772ba4`
- **Exact Timestamp**: `2025-10-23 03:29:51.284 UTC`
- **Unix Timestamp**: `1761190191284` ms
- **Query Text**: `"White homes with granite countertops and wood floors"`
- **Multi-Query Mode**: `True`

### Sub-Queries Generated

The system generated 3 feature-specific sub-queries with different weights:

1. **granite_countertops** (weight: 1.0x, strategy: max)
   - Sub-query: `"granite stone countertops kitchen surfaces"`

2. **white_exterior** (weight: 2.0x, strategy: max)
   - Sub-query: `"white painted house exterior facade siding building"`

3. **hardwood_floors** (weight: 1.0x, strategy: max)
   - Sub-query: `"hardwood flooring floors interior wood planks"`

**Key Insight**: The `white_exterior` feature was weighted 2x higher than the other features, likely because it's the primary/most visible characteristic.

## Key Features That Made It Work

### 1. RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) Diversification
From commit `ac6660b`:
```
Implement greedy selection in calculate_multi_query_image_score()
- Ensure each sub-query contributes exactly 1 distinct image to RRF score
- Prevents one feature (e.g., hardwood floors) from dominating all top-K images
- Add detailed logging for RRF image selection process
```

**Algorithm**:
1. Calculate similarity scores for all (sub-query, image) pairs
2. Greedily select best match, then exclude that sub-query
3. Each sub-query contributes exactly 1 image to the final score

### 2. Image Weight Boosting for Visual Queries
From commit `ac6660b`:
```
Modify calculate_adaptive_weights_v2() to boost images when visual features present
- Mixed queries with â‰¥1 visual feature now use Image k=35 (vs 55 before)
- Ensures properties with strong visual matches rank at the top
- Fixes issue where visually-matching properties ranked too low
```

### 3. Feature-Based Query Splitting
- The LLM correctly identified 3 distinct features
- Each feature got its own specialized sub-query
- Different weights reflected feature importance (white_exterior: 2x)

### 4. Max Strategy for Feature Matching
- Each sub-query used "max" strategy
- Takes the best matching image/text for that specific feature
- Prevents averaging that would dilute strong matches

## What Changed After the Good Search

### Timeline
1. **03:29:51 UTC**: Good search results (all 10 = 100% match)
2. **04:10:18 UTC**: New deployment of `hearth-search-v2` (40.5 minutes later)
3. **Result**: Likely introduction of changes that degraded quality

### Potential Issues in Later Deployment
Need to compare `ac6660b` with the code deployed in `hearth-search-v2` to identify:
- Changes to RRF diversification logic
- Changes to image weight boosting
- Changes to sub-query weighting
- Changes to feature extraction/classification

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Compare Code Versions**
   - Diff `ac6660b` against current `hearth-search-v2` code
   - Identify what changed in the RRF/image scoring logic

2. **Review Sub-Query Weighting**
   - The 2x weight for `white_exterior` seems important
   - Verify current code applies proper weights

3. **Test RRF Diversification**
   - Ensure greedy selection is still working
   - Verify each sub-query contributes distinct images

### Long-Term Improvements
1. **Version Tracking in Logs**
   - Add git commit hash to search logs
   - Add deployment timestamp to logs
   - Makes investigations like this easier

2. **A/B Testing Infrastructure**
   - Keep "good" version running alongside new deployments
   - Compare quality metrics before full rollout

3. **Quality Regression Testing**
   - Establish baseline queries like this one
   - Run automated tests after each deployment
   - Alert if quality drops below threshold

## Conclusion

The "good" search at **2025-10-23 03:29:51 UTC** was powered by:
- **Git commit**: `ac6660b` - "Implement RRF diversification and image weight boosting"
- **Lambda function**: `hearth-search-detailed-scoring`
- **Deployment**: 8.5 hours before the search

The key was the combination of:
1. RRF diversification ensuring each feature contributed
2. Image weight boosting for visual features
3. Proper sub-query weighting (2x for white_exterior)
4. Max strategy for feature matching

The deployment 40 minutes later likely broke these results. Need to identify what changed.
