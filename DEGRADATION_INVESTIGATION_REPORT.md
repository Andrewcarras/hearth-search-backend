# Search Results Degradation Investigation Report

**Investigation Date:** 2025-10-23
**Time Window:** 03:30:00 UTC - 05:38:00 UTC (10:30 PM EST - 12:38 AM EST)
**Query Analyzed:** "White homes with granite countertops and wood floors" (multi_query=true)

---

## Executive Summary

**MYSTERY SOLVED:** The search results actually **IMPROVED** during this window, not degraded!

- **Degradation Period:** 03:30 UTC - 04:10 UTC (40 minutes)
- **Recovery Point:** 04:10:44 UTC (exact to the second)
- **Root Cause:** Lambda deployment of commit `46d9f51` fixing sub-query ambiguity
- **Problem:** Bad zpids (12778555, 70592220 - brick homes) appeared before fix
- **Solution:** Deployment fixed the issue by improving sub-query generation

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The multi-query system was generating ambiguous sub-queries that matched incorrect properties:

**Example:**
- Query: "White homes with granite countertops and wood floors"
- OLD Sub-query: "white exterior"
- Problem: Matched white skies, white interiors, AND white houses

### The Fix (Commit 46d9f51)

#### 1. Enhanced LLM Prompt
Added explicit examples and critical warnings:

```python
IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS TO AVOID AMBIGUITY:
- "White house" ‚Üí "white painted exterior house facade siding"
  (NOT "white kitchen" or "white walls")
- "Blue exterior" ‚Üí "blue painted house exterior facade siding building"
  (NOT "blue sky" or "blue interior")
- "Granite countertops" ‚Üí "granite stone countertops kitchen surfaces"
  (specify KITCHEN)

**CRITICAL**: For exterior colors, ALWAYS include words like "house",
"building", "facade", "siding", "painted" to distinguish from sky,
landscape, or interior elements.
```

#### 2. Smart Fallback Logic
Rewrote fallback to add context based on feature type:

```python
if '_exterior' in feature:
    # Exterior color: add explicit house/building context
    color = feature.replace('_exterior', '')
    query = f"{color} painted house exterior facade siding building"
    weight = 2.0
elif 'countertops' in feature:
    # Countertops: specify kitchen
    material = feature.replace('_countertops', '')
    query = f"{material} stone countertops kitchen surfaces"
    weight = 1.0
elif 'floors' in feature:
    # Flooring: specify interior floors
    material = feature.replace('_floors', '')
    query = f"{material} flooring floors interior wood planks"
    weight = 1.0
```

**Result:**
- OLD: "white exterior" (ambiguous - matches sky/interior/houses)
- NEW: "white painted house exterior facade siding building" (specific - only houses)

## Deployment Details

### Git Commits in Time Window

All commits from 22:13 EST (02:13 UTC) to 23:39 EST (03:39 UTC):

```
02:13 UTC - ac6660b - Implement RRF diversification and image weight boosting
02:15 UTC - 39d4c61 - Clean up temporary test scripts and migration files
02:24 UTC - 46d9f51 - Fix sub-query ambiguity to avoid sky/background matches ‚≠ê
02:32 UTC - 4be2778 - Add standalone Multi-Query Search page to navigation
02:35 UTC - 0bfe73d - Remove Multi-Query Search button from navigation
03:19 UTC - 0bf68b5 - Add multi-query mode toggle to main search UI
03:29 UTC - b94ff15 - Fix score breakdown consistency for multi-query mode
03:39 UTC - dce8f7c - Add auto-refresh to analytics dashboard
```

**Critical Commit:** `46d9f51` (02:24 UTC) - This was deployed at 04:10 UTC

### Why the Delay?
The commit was made at **02:24 UTC** but wasn't deployed to Lambda until **04:10 UTC**.
**Deployment delay:** 1 hour 46 minutes

This explains why bad results persisted from 03:30 - 04:10 UTC even though the fix was committed earlier.

## Key Findings

### 1. **EXACT Transition Timestamp**
**2025-10-23 04:10:44.290 UTC** (to the millisecond)

### 2. **Trigger Event**
Lambda deployment of commit `46d9f51` at **04:10:18 UTC** (26 seconds before recovery)

### 3. **What Changed**
Sub-query generation logic improved to avoid ambiguous matches:
- Added explicit context words ("house", "building", "facade")
- Implemented smart fallback with feature-type-specific context
- Increased weight for exterior color queries (2.0)

### 4. **Impact**
**Immediate improvement:**
- Bad zpids removed from results
- More relevant properties returned
- Avg score improved from 0.0512 to 0.0577 (+12.7%)

### 5. **No Errors**
- Zero CloudWatch errors during deployment
- Zero warnings in logs
- Clean, successful deployment

## Corrected Understanding

**Initial Report:** "Search results degraded between 10:30 PM and 12:38 AM"

**Actual Timeline:**
1. **Before 03:30 UTC:** Unknown state (no data)
2. **03:30 - 04:10 UTC:** BAD results (possibly existing issue, first captured)
3. **04:10:18 UTC:** FIX deployed
4. **04:10:44 UTC:** Results IMPROVED (fix took effect)
5. **04:10:44 - Present:** GOOD results

**Conclusion:** The "degradation" was actually the pre-existing bad state. The event at 04:10 UTC was the **RECOVERY**, not the degradation.

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Completed Actions
1. Sub-query ambiguity fix deployed successfully
2. Bad zpids (12778555, 70592220) removed from results
3. System now generates unambiguous sub-queries

### üîç Future Improvements
1. **Reduce Deployment Delay:**
   - Commit was ready at 02:24 UTC but deployed at 04:10 UTC (1h 46m delay)
   - Consider automated deployment pipeline for critical fixes

2. **Pre-Deployment Testing:**
   - Test queries like "White homes" in staging before production
   - Automated regression tests for known bad zpids

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Alert when bad zpids (12778555, 70592220) appear in top 10 results
   - Track avg_score drops below threshold (< 0.05)

4. **Documentation:**
   - Add test cases for color + material queries
   - Document sub-query generation rules
