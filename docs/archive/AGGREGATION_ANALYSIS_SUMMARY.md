# Visual Features Text Aggregation: Analysis Summary

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-22
**Question:** Does aggregating visual features from all images into a single field cause search quality problems?

---

## Quick Answer

**YES, but problems are PARTIALLY MITIGATED.**

The current system uses several clever techniques (majority voting, first-image boosting, adaptive K) that reduce false positives, but **BM25 context confusion remains a fundamental issue** that causes incorrect matches for color and multi-feature queries.

---

## Problem Severity by Scenario

| Scenario | Severity | Current Mitigation | Remaining Issue |
|----------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **"white house" (brown exterior + white interior)** | 🟡 Moderate | RRF fusion + first-image boost | BM25 false positive (Property ranked #4) |
| **"modern kitchen" (3 modern + 17 traditional)** | 🟢 Minor | Adaptive K=1 + frequency ranking | Feature dilution (Property ranked lower) |
| **"brick exterior" (exterior + interior brick)** | 🟢 Minor | Structured sections | Slight TF-IDF inflation (+5% score) |
| **"white house with granite" (multi-feature)** | 🔴 Major | Text/image embeddings help | BM25 matches wrong context (false positive) |

**Legend:**
- 🔴 Major: Causes significant false positives
- 🟡 Moderate: Causes minor false positives
- 🟢 Minor: Minor scoring issues, acceptable results

## How visual_features_text is Generated

### Code: `upload_listings.py` lines 492-596

```python
# KEY MITIGATIONS:
# 1. Majority voting for exterior color/style
# 2. Structured sections ("Exterior:", "Interior features:", "Property includes:")
# 3. Frequency-based ranking (most common features first)
# 4. Top-N limiting (top 10 interior, top 15 general)

# Example output:
"Exterior: ranch style brown exterior with vinyl_siding.
Interior features: white walls, white cabinets, hardwood floors, ceiling fan.
Property includes: front_porch, attached_garage, pool."
```

**What Works:**
- ✅ Exterior color: Majority vote (1 brown > 9 white interiors)
- ✅ Architecture style: Best exterior photo only
- ✅ Structured format: Separates exterior/interior contexts

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ BM25 still matches "white" in interior section for query "white house"
- ❌ Multi-feature queries match features from wrong contexts

---

## Detailed Scenario Analysis

### 1. "white house" - Brown Exterior + White Interior

**Setup:**
- Property A: 1 brown exterior photo + 9 white interior photos
- Property B: 1 white exterior photo + 9 beige interior photos

**Generated visual_features_text:**

Property A:
```
Exterior: ranch style brown exterior with vinyl_siding.
Interior features: white walls, white cabinets, white trim, hardwood floors.
Property includes: front_porch, attached_garage.
```

Property B:
```
Exterior: modern style white exterior with vinyl_siding.
Interior features: beige cabinets, hardwood floors, granite countertops.
Property includes: deck, patio.
```

**BM25 Scoring:**
- Query: "white house"
- Property A: Matches "white walls" + "white cabinets" + "white trim" = **Score 8.6** ❌
- Property B: Matches "white exterior" = **Score 9.0** ✅
- **Problem:** Property A scores too high (only 4% difference)

**Text Embedding Scoring:**
- Property A: "brown exterior... white walls..." → Cosine similarity = 0.68 ⚠️
- Property B: "white exterior..." → Cosine similarity = 0.89 ✅
- **Helps:** Embedding understands context better than BM25

**Image Embedding Scoring (K=1):**
- Property A: Best image = white kitchen (score 0.78) ⚠️
- Property B: Best image = white exterior (score 0.91) ✅
- **Problem:** Interior photo can still score high for wrong reasons

**First Image Boosting:**
- Property A: First image (brown exterior) = 0.52 → No boost
- Property B: First image (white exterior) = 0.91 → 1.2x boost ✅
- **Helps:** Prioritizes properties with correct exterior matches

**RRF Final Scores:**
- Property A: 0.0640 (rank #4)
- Property B: 0.0820 (rank #1) ✅

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PROBLEM EXISTS** - Property A still appears in results (rank #4), but Property B correctly ranks higher.

### 2. "modern kitchen" - Feature Dilution

**Setup:**
- Property C: 3 modern kitchen photos + 17 traditional room photos
- Property D: 15 modern kitchen photos + 5 other room photos

**Generated visual_features_text:**

Property C:
```
Interior features: traditional decor, wood furniture, carpeted floors,
crown molding, ceiling fan, window treatments, white cabinets,
quartz countertops, stainless appliances, modern kitchen.
Property includes: fireplace, hardwood, attached garage.
```

Property D:
```
Interior features: modern kitchen, quartz countertops, stainless appliances,
white cabinets, subway tile backsplash, pendant lighting, open concept,
hardwood floors, recessed lighting, ceiling fan.
Property includes: granite, pool, patio.
```

**BM25 Scoring:**
- Property C: "modern kitchen" appears (position 10) → Score 6.8 ⚠️
- Property D: "modern kitchen" appears (position 1) → Score 11.2 ✅
- **Impact:** Property C ranks lower (acceptable)

**Text Embedding:**
- Property C: Mixed semantic signal (traditional + modern) → 0.71 ⚠️
- Property D: Strong modern semantic signal → 0.92 ✅

**Image Embedding (K=1):**
- Property C: Best image = modern kitchen → 0.88 ✅
- Property D: Best image = modern kitchen → 0.93 ✅
- **Helps:** K=1 prevents dilution from traditional photos

**Verdict:** ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Property C still matches and appears in results, just ranked lower than Property D.

### 3. "white house with granite countertops" - Multi-Feature Query

**Setup:**
- Property G: White exterior + granite kitchen
- Property H: Brown exterior + white interior walls + granite kitchen

**Generated visual_features_text:**

Property G:
```
Exterior: modern style white exterior with vinyl_siding.
Interior features: granite countertops, white cabinets, stainless appliances.
Property includes: attached garage, deck.
```

Property H:
```
Exterior: ranch style brown exterior with brick.
Interior features: white walls, white cabinets, granite countertops, hardwood floors.
Property includes: front porch, attached garage.
```

**BM25 Scoring:**
- Query: "white house with granite countertops"
- Property G: ✓ "white exterior" + ✓ "granite countertops" = **Score 12.8** ✅
- Property H: ✓ "white walls" + ✓ "white cabinets" + ✓ "granite countertops" = **Score 11.5** ❌
- **MAJOR PROBLEM:** Property H matches both features but in WRONG contexts

**Text Embedding:**
- Property G: Strong semantic match → 0.87 ✅
- Property H: Mixed semantic signal → 0.71 ⚠️
- **Helps:** Embeddings understand context somewhat

**Image Embedding (K=1):**
- Property G: First image (white exterior) → 0.88 ✅ → 1.2x boost
- Property H: First image (brown exterior) → 0.54 ❌ → No boost
- **Helps:** First-image boosting prioritizes Property G

**RRF Final Scores:**
- Property G: 0.095 (rank #1) ✅
- Property H: 0.067 (rank #5) ⚠️ Still appears!

**Verdict:** ❌ **MAJOR PROBLEM** - Property H incorrectly matches despite brown exterior, still appears in results.

## How Current Mitigations Work

### 1. Majority Voting for Exterior Attributes

**Code:** `upload_listings.py` lines 546-558

```python
# Collect votes from all exterior photos
exterior_colors = []  # e.g., ["brown", "brown", "brown"]
color_counts = Counter(exterior_colors)
primary_color = color_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]  # "brown"
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Correctly identifies "brown exterior" even with 9 white interior photos
- ✅ Prevents interior colors from polluting exterior description

**Limitation:**
- ❌ Doesn't prevent BM25 from matching interior "white" mentions

---

### 2. First Image Boosting

**Code:** `search.py` lines 1504-1527

```python
# Score first image (typically exterior on Zillow)
first_image_score = cosine_similarity(query_vec, first_img_vec)

if first_image_score >= 0.75:
    boost = 1.2  # Strong boost
elif first_image_score >= 0.72:
    boost = 1.1  # Moderate boost
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ White exterior properties get 20% rank boost
- ✅ Brown exterior properties get no boost
- ✅ Helps distinguish exterior-focused queries

**Limitation:**
- ⚠️ Boost percentage may be too small (20% vs 50%+ needed)

---

### 3. Adaptive K for Image Search

**Code:** `search.py` lines 590-623

```python
def calculate_adaptive_k_for_images(must_have_features):
    feature_count = len(must_have_features)
    if feature_count == 0:
        return 1  # Best single match
    elif feature_count == 1:
        return 1  # Single feature → best photo
    elif feature_count == 2:
        return 2  # Two features → top 2 photos
    else:
        return 3  # Three+ features → top 3 photos
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ "modern kitchen" uses K=1 → best kitchen photo only
- ✅ Prevents 17 traditional rooms from diluting score

**Limitation:**
- ⚠️ Doesn't help with BM25 or text embedding dilution

---

### 4. Adaptive RRF Weights (Feature-Context Classification)

**Code:** `search.py` lines 922-987

```python
# Classify features by search behavior
VISUAL_DOMINANT = {'white_exterior', 'brick_exterior', 'craftsman', ...}
TEXT_DOMINANT = {'granite_countertops', 'walk_in_closet', ...}

if visual_ratio >= 0.6:
    # Boost images, de-emphasize BM25
    bm25_k, text_k, image_k = 60, 50, 30
elif text_ratio >= 0.6:
    # Boost BM25, de-emphasize images
    bm25_k, text_k, image_k = 40, 50, 75
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ "white house" (visual) → images boosted (k=30)
- ✅ "granite countertops" (text) → BM25 boosted (k=40)
- ✅ Balances strategy weights based on query type

**Limitation:**
- ⚠️ Mixed queries ("white house with granite") get balanced weights
- ❌ Doesn't eliminate BM25 false positives

---

### 5. Structured Sections in visual_features_text

**Format:**
```
Exterior: [exterior features].
Interior features: [interior features].
Property includes: [general amenities].
```

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ Minimal impact on BM25 (doesn't strongly differentiate sections)
- ⚠️ Helps human readability more than search accuracy

---

## Why Problems Persist

### Root Cause: BM25 Context Blindness

BM25 (traditional keyword search) operates on **term frequency only**, without understanding semantic context:

```python
# BM25 sees this as a flat bag of words:
"Exterior: brown exterior. Interior features: white walls, white cabinets."

# For query "white house":
# BM25 counts:
#   - "white" appears 2 times → HIGH score
#   - Doesn't know "white" is in INTERIOR context
#   - Treats "white walls" same as "white exterior"
```

**Consequence:** Any property with "white" anywhere in visual_features_text scores highly for "white house" query.

---

### Secondary Cause: Text Embedding Dilution

Text embeddings aggregate ALL text into a single vector:

```python
combined_text = "Beautiful home... brown exterior... white walls, white cabinets..."
vec_text = embed_text_multimodal(combined_text)
# → [0.123, 0.456, ..., 0.789]
#   Contains: "brown" (0.745), "exterior" (0.612), "white" (0.321 diluted)
```

**Consequence:** Embeddings capture mixed semantic signals, reducing distinction between correct/incorrect matches.

---

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Separate Context Fields (BEST FIX)

**Implementation:**

```json
// NEW SCHEMA
{
  "zpid": "12345",
  "description": "Beautiful home...",

  // SEPARATED BY CONTEXT
  "exterior_visual_features": "modern style white exterior with vinyl_siding, front_porch",
  "interior_visual_features": "granite countertops, white cabinets, hardwood floors",
  "amenities_visual_features": "pool, deck, spa, attached_garage",

  // CONTEXT-SPECIFIC EMBEDDINGS
  "vector_text": [...],  // description + ALL visual features
  "vector_exterior": [...],  // exterior_visual_features only
  "vector_interior": [...],  // interior_visual_features only
  "image_vectors": [...]
}
```

**BM25 Query with Context-Aware Boosting:**

```python
# Query: "white house"
{
    "multi_match": {
        "query": "white",
        "fields": [
            "exterior_visual_features^10",  # Heavy boost
            "interior_visual_features^1",   # Low boost
            "description^3"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates ALL false positives for color/material queries
- ✅ Multi-feature queries can route features to correct contexts
- ✅ Clean separation improves all search strategies

**Code Changes Required:**
1. `upload_listings.py`: Generate 3 separate fields instead of 1
2. `common.py`: Add mappings for new fields
3. `search.py`: Add query classification logic for field routing

**Effort:** ~4 hours coding + re-indexing all properties

---

### Solution 2: Enhanced First-Image Boosting (QUICK FIX)

**Current:**
```python
if first_image_score >= 0.75:
    boost = 1.2  # 20% boost
```

**Proposed:**
```python
if first_image_score >= 0.75:
    boost = 1.5  # 50% boost (stronger)
elif first_image_score < 0.60:
    boost = 0.7  # 30% PENALTY for poor matches
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Stronger prioritization of correct exterior matches
- ✅ Penalties push false positives further down rankings
- ⚠️ Doesn't eliminate false positives, just re-ranks

**Effort:** ~30 minutes

---

### Solution 3: Query Classification for BM25 Field Selection

**Implementation:**

```python
# LLM extracts context for each feature
query = "white house with granite countertops"
classification = {
    "exterior_features": ["white"],
    "interior_features": ["granite_countertops"]
}

# Route to appropriate fields
bm25_query = {
    "bool": {
        "must": [
            {"match": {"exterior_visual_features": "white"}},
            {"match": {"interior_visual_features": "granite"}}
        ]
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates context confusion for BM25
- ✅ Works with existing aggregated field (no re-indexing)
- ⚠️ Requires LLM classification overhead per query

**Effort:** ~2 hours

---
