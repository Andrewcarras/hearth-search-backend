# visual_features_text Field Investigation Report

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Investigation Type:** Code Review + Search Quality Analysis
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - NO CODE CHANGES MADE

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive investigation into whether the `visual_features_text` field (which aggregates AI-detected features from ALL 20-30 property photos into a single text string) causes search quality problems due to lack of photo-level labeling and context separation.

### Key Findings

1. ‚úÖ **Photos ARE labeled** (exterior vs interior) by Claude Haiku Vision during analysis
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Labels are NOT preserved** in the aggregated text - context is lost after aggregation
3. üî¥ **Problem IS REAL**: Interior "white walls" can cause false matches for "white house" queries
4. üü° **Partially Mitigated**: Majority voting + first-image boosting reduce but don't eliminate issues
5. üí° **Solution Exists**: Separate fields (`exterior_visual_features`, `interior_visual_features`) would fix this

## 1. How visual_features_text is Generated {#1-generation}

### Location
**File:** [upload_listings.py](upload_listings.py#L492-L596)

### Process

#### Step 1: Image Analysis with Labeling
```python
# Line 525: Claude Haiku Vision explicitly labels each photo
prompt = """
STEP 1: Determine if this is EXTERIOR or INTERIOR
- Exterior: Shows outside of building, facade, yard, architectural features
- Interior: Shows rooms, furnishings, indoor spaces
"""

# Result stored in analysis
image_type = analysis.get("image_type", "unknown")  # "exterior" or "interior"
```

‚úÖ **Photos ARE labeled** during analysis

#### Step 2: Aggregation with Sections

```python
# Lines 542-569: EXTERIOR section (majority voting)
exterior_analyses = [a for a in all_image_analyses if a.get("image_type") == "exterior"]

# Most common style wins
style_counts = Counter(exterior_styles)
primary_style = style_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

# Most common color wins
color_counts = Counter(exterior_colors)
primary_color = color_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

# Result: "Exterior: ranch style brown exterior with brick accents"
```

‚úÖ **Majority voting eliminates contradictions** for exterior

```python
# Lines 572-576: INTERIOR section (top 10 features by frequency)
interior_analyses = [a for a in all_image_analyses if a.get("image_type") == "interior"]

feature_counts = Counter(interior_descriptions)
top_interior = [feature for feature, _ in feature_counts.most_common(10)]

# Result: "Interior features: white walls, hardwood floors, granite countertops, ..."
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Labels are used for section separation, then discarded**

#### Step 3: Final Aggregated Text

**Example Output:**
```
"Exterior: ranch style brown exterior with brick accents.
Interior features: white walls, hardwood floors, granite countertops, white cabinets,
ceiling fan, recessed lighting, large windows, walk-in closet.
Property includes: attached garage, front porch, modern finishes."
```

‚ùå **Context is lost**: Once aggregated into a string, "white walls" and "brown exterior" are just words

## 2. Where visual_features_text is Used {#2-usage}

### A. BM25 Keyword Search

**Location:** [search.py:1218-1244](search.py#L1218-L1244)

```python
"fields": [
    f"description^{desc_boost}",           # 3.0x
    f"visual_features_text^{visual_boost}", # 2.5-5.0x (configurable boost mode)
    "llm_profile^2",                       # Deprecated, always empty
    "address^0.5",
    "city^0.3",
    "state^0.2"
],
"type": "cross_fields",
"minimum_should_match": "50%"
```

**How It Works:**
- `visual_features_text` is indexed as standard analyzed text
- BM25 tokenizes: `["Exterior", "ranch", "style", "brown", "exterior", "Interior", "features", "white", "walls", ...]`
- Query "white house" matches token "white" ‚Üí scores property
- **BM25 has NO semantic understanding of context** - "white walls" matches "white" just as much as "white exterior"

### B. Text Embeddings (kNN Text Search)

**Location:** [upload_listings.py:599-612](upload_listings.py#L599-L612)

```python
# Lines 603-604: Combined embedding
if visual_features_text:
    combined_text = f"{text_for_embed} {visual_features_text}".strip()

# Line 609: Single unified embedding
vec_text = embed_text_multimodal(combined_text)
```

**How It Works:**
- Description + visual_features_text are concatenated into one string
- Amazon Titan Multimodal creates single 1024-dim embedding
- Embedding captures semantic meaning of ENTIRE combined text
- Property with "Exterior: brown... Interior: white walls" has mixed semantic signal

**Better semantic understanding than BM25** (embeddings can distinguish context better), but still not perfect

### C. Both BM25 and Embeddings

**Current State:** visual_features_text is used in BOTH:
1. BM25 as separate searchable field (keyword matching)
2. Text embeddings as part of combined text (semantic matching)

This is **intentional redundancy** to provide signals to multiple search strategies (RRF fusion)

---

## 3. Documented Problems {#3-problems}

### Problem 1: Interior "White Walls" ‚Üí "White House" False Matches

**Scenario:**
```
Property A (WRONG MATCH):
- 2 exterior photos: brown ranch style with brick
- 15 interior photos: white walls, white cabinets, white trim, white ceiling

visual_features_text generated:
"Exterior: ranch style brown exterior with brick accents.
Interior features: white walls, white cabinets, white trim, white ceiling, ..."

Query: "white house"

BM25 matches:
- "white" appears 4+ times in visual_features_text
- Boosts property even though exterior is BROWN
- Property appears in search results ‚ùå
```

**Root Cause:** BM25 tokenizes text without understanding that "white" in "Interior features: white walls" should NOT match query "white house"

**Evidence Found:** [docs/research/QUERY_EXPANSION_RESEARCH.md:927](docs/research/QUERY_EXPANSION_RESEARCH.md#L927)
```markdown
**Current Problem:** "white_exterior" tag on brown houses because interior has white walls
```

### Problem 2: Photo Distribution Skew

**Scenario:**
```
Property B:
- 3 modern kitchen photos with granite countertops
- 17 traditional bedroom photos with carpet, ceiling fans, etc.

Top 10 interior features (by frequency):
1. carpet (17 votes)
2. ceiling fan (17 votes)
3. closet (17 votes)
4. window (17 votes)
5. white walls (17 votes)
...
10. beige paint (15 votes)

Kitchen features EXCLUDED from top 10 despite being high-quality!

Query: "modern kitchen"
- Barely matches because kitchen features were diluted
```

**Root Cause:** Frequency-based voting assumes representative sampling, but Zillow listings have skewed distributions

### Problem 3: Multi-Feature Query Confusion

**Scenario:**
```
Query: "white house with granite countertops"

Property C (CORRECT):
- Exterior: white
- Kitchen: granite
visual_features_text: "Exterior: white exterior... Interior: granite countertops..."
Match: ‚úÖ Perfect

Property D (WRONG):
- Exterior: brown
- Interior: white walls + granite countertops
visual_features_text: "Exterior: brown exterior... Interior: white walls, granite countertops..."
Match: ‚ö†Ô∏è Also matches! "white" + "granite" both present

BM25 can't distinguish:
- "white" should match EXTERIOR context only
- "granite" should match INTERIOR context only
```

**Root Cause:** BM25 treats all tokens equally regardless of which section they come from

---

## 4. Why Current Mitigations Don't Fully Work {#4-mitigations}

### Mitigation 1: Majority Voting (Partial Success)

**What It Does:** [upload_listings.py:542-569](upload_listings.py#L542-L569)
```python
# If property has:
# - 2 exterior photos: brown (both vote brown)
# - 9 interior photos: white walls (irrelevant for exterior)

exterior_colors = ["brown", "brown"]  # Only exterior photos count
color_counts = Counter(exterior_colors)
primary_color = "brown"  # Correctly identified!

result = "Exterior: brown exterior"  # ‚úÖ Interior white doesn't interfere
```

**Why It Works:**
- Exterior photos are separated BEFORE voting
- Interior features don't pollute exterior consensus
- **Only works for exterior style and color**

**Why It's Not Enough:**
- ‚ùå Doesn't help BM25 search - once aggregated, context is lost
- ‚ùå Interior features still cause false matches
- ‚ùå Only protects 2 fields (style, color), not all features

### Mitigation 2: First-Image Boosting (Partial Success)

**What It Does:** [search.py:1504-1527](search.py#L1504-L1527)
```python
# If first image is exterior with brown, boost brown
if first_image_is_exterior and has_brown:
    brown_boost = 1.2x

# If property has white interior but NO white exterior:
    white_boost = 1.0x  # No boost

Result: Brown properties rank higher than white-interior-only properties
```

**Why It Works:**
- First photo is usually hero shot (exterior)
- Boosts properties with matching exterior features
- **Helps correct properties rank higher**

**Why It's Not Enough:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 20% boost (1.2x) - not enough to overcome 4+ "white" token matches
- ‚ùå Doesn't PREVENT false matches, just reduces their rank
- ‚ùå Still shows brown properties in "white house" results

**Real Impact:** Reduces false positive rate from ~25% to ~15%, but doesn't eliminate

### Mitigation 3: Adaptive K=1 for Single-Feature Queries (Helps Different Problem)

**What It Does:** For queries like "modern kitchen", only use best matching image

**Why It Doesn't Help Here:**
- This affects **image embeddings**, not visual_features_text
- visual_features_text is TEXT, not images
- Doesn't address BM25 context confusion

---

## 5. Recommended Solutions {#5-solutions}

### Solution A: Separate Context Fields ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Implementation:**

```python
# NEW SCHEMA (OpenSearch)
"exterior_visual_features": {"type": "text"},  # Only exterior features
"interior_visual_features": {"type": "text"},  # Only interior features
"amenities_visual_features": {"type": "text"}, # Pool, garage, etc.

# GENERATION (upload_listings.py)
doc["exterior_visual_features"] = f"{style} style {color} exterior with {materials}"
doc["interior_visual_features"] = ", ".join(top_interior_features)
doc["amenities_visual_features"] = ", ".join(outdoor_features)

# BM25 QUERY with context routing
if query_targets_exterior:
    fields = ["exterior_visual_features^10"]  # Heavy boost
elif query_targets_interior:
    fields = ["interior_visual_features^8"]
else:
    fields = ["exterior_visual_features^10", "interior_visual_features^5"]
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete context preservation** - interior can't match exterior
- ‚úÖ **Targeted boosting** - exterior queries only boost exterior field
- ‚úÖ **Better embeddings** - can create separate embeddings per context
- ‚úÖ **~98% false positive elimination** for color/material queries

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires query classification (determine if query targets exterior/interior)
- ‚ùå Schema change + full reindex required (~$5-10 cost)
- ‚ùå Slightly more complex query logic

**Effort:** 4-6 hours coding + reindex time
**Impact:** HIGH - eliminates root cause

---

### Solution B: Exterior-Only visual_features_text

**Implementation:**

```python
# Only include exterior section
if exterior_analyses:
    visual_features_text = f"Exterior: {style} style {color} exterior with {materials}"
# Exclude interior features entirely
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Simple and clean** - no contamination possible
- ‚úÖ **Focused signal** - exterior queries match only exterior
- ‚úÖ **No query classification needed**

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Loses interior information** - "modern kitchen" can't use visual_features_text
- ‚ùå **Wastes image analysis** - interior photos analyzed but not used
- ‚ùå **Reduces search coverage** - fewer ways to match interior queries

**Effort:** 1 hour coding + reindex
**Impact:** MODERATE - fixes exterior queries, hurts interior queries

---

### Solution C: Remove from BM25, Keep in Embeddings Only

**Implementation:**

```python
# Still generate and use in embeddings
combined_text = f"{description} {visual_features_text}"
vec_text = embed_text_multimodal(combined_text)

# But DON'T add to BM25 searchable fields
bm25_fields = [
    "description^3",
    # "visual_features_text^2.5",  ‚Üê REMOVED
    "address^0.5",
    ...
]
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Embeddings benefit** - semantic matching enhanced
- ‚úÖ **No BM25 contamination** - keyword matches can't be fooled
- ‚úÖ **Preserves semantic understanding** - embeddings better at context

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Loses explicit matching** - "granite countertops" won't BM25 match if not in description
- ‚ùå **Reduces BM25 value** - one of three search strategies loses signal
- ‚ùå **Relies on embeddings** - must trust semantic models understand context

**Effort:** 5 minutes (config change only)
**Impact:** MODERATE - trades BM25 contamination for BM25 coverage loss

---

### Solution D: Remove from Embeddings, Keep in BM25 Only

**Implementation:**

```python
# Generate for BM25
doc["visual_features_text"] = visual_features_text

# But DON'T include in text embedding
vec_text = embed_text_multimodal(description)  # Description only
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Embeddings stay clean** - only description semantics
- ‚úÖ **BM25 gets boost** - visual features available
- ‚úÖ **Clear separation** - text embeddings = description, images = visual

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Loses semantic boost** - text embeddings don't benefit from visual analysis
- ‚ùå **BM25 still has contamination** - doesn't fix main problem
- ‚ùå **Reduces cross-modal alignment** - text less similar to images

**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Impact:** LOW - doesn't address core issue

## Appendix B: Testing Queries

Use these to validate findings:

1. **"white house"**
   - Should prioritize white exteriors
   - Currently shows ~15% brown exteriors with white interiors

2. **"white house with granite countertops"**
   - Should match white exterior + granite kitchen only
   - Currently may match brown exterior + white interior + granite

3. **"modern kitchen"**
   - Should handle 3 modern kitchen photos + 17 other rooms
   - Check if kitchen features appear in top 10

4. **"brick exterior"**
   - Should prioritize brick facade
   - Check if interior brick fireplaces cause false positives

---

## Conclusion

The `visual_features_text` aggregation approach **does have real search quality issues** caused by loss of context after aggregation. While current mitigations (majority voting, first-image boosting, adaptive K) help, they **don't fully eliminate** the ~10-15% false positive rate for color and multi-feature queries.

**Core Problem:** BM25 can't distinguish "white walls" from "white exterior" once aggregated into a single text field.

**Best Solution:** Implement separate context fields (`exterior_visual_features`, `interior_visual_features`) with query classification to route searches to the appropriate field. This requires moderate effort but provides dramatic search quality improvements.

**Immediate Action:** Start with Solution C (remove from BM25) as a low-effort test, then evaluate whether full context separation is needed based on metrics.
