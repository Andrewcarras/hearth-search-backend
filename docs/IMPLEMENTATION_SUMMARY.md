# Implementation Summary: Enhanced Multimodal Search

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to enable natural language searches with visual features, architecture styles, and proximity-based filtering.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Query Parsing (common.py:701-843)
The `extract_query_constraints()` function now extracts:

- **Visual Features**: balcony, porch, deck, fence, white_fence, blue_exterior, etc.
- **Architecture Styles**: modern, craftsman, colonial, mid_century_modern, etc.
- **Proximity Requirements**: POI type, distance, and drive time
- **Traditional Filters**: price, beds, baths, acreage

**Parsing Methods:**
1. **Primary**: Claude LLM via Bedrock (more accurate, handles complex queries)
2. **Fallback**: Regex-based keyword matching (works when LLM unavailable)

### 2. Vision-Based Feature Detection (common.py:522-644)
The `classify_architecture_style_vision()` function now extracts from images:

- **Architecture Style**: Primary style classification from 25+ styles
- **Visual Features**: balcony, porch, fence (with type/color), deck, garage, etc.
- **Exterior Colors**: Specific color identification (white, blue, gray, etc.)
- **Materials**: brick, stucco, siding, stone, wood, etc.
- **Structural Details**: roof type, windows, columns, chimney, etc.

### 3. Geocoding & Proximity Search (common.py:846-937)
The `geocode_location()` function enables location-based searches:

- **Supported POIs**: schools, grocery stores, gyms, parks, hospitals, offices, etc.
- **Implementation**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim (free, production-ready)
- **Distance Handling**: Converts "10 minute drive" to km estimates

### 4. Enhanced Upload Pipeline (upload_listings.py:312-332)
Updated to process and index visual features from images.

### 5. Search Integration (search.py:216-274)
Updated search handler to support architecture style and proximity filters.

## ðŸ“Š Test Results

All example queries **PASSED** testing:

âœ… "Show me homes with a balcony, a blue exterior and a modern architecture style"
âœ… "Show me homes with a mid-century modern style"
âœ… "Show me homes with a white fence in the backyard"
âœ… "Show me homes with a colonial style that are near a grocery store and a gym"
âœ… "Show me homes near an elementary school"
âœ… "Show me homes within a 10 minute drive from my office and have a backyard"

Run tests: `python3 test_query_parsing.py`

## ðŸ”‘ Key Improvements

1. **Visual Feature Detection**: Properties are now tagged with visual features extracted from images (balcony, fence types, exterior colors)
2. **Architecture Style Classification**: Automated style detection from both text descriptions AND images
3. **Proximity Search**: Location-based filtering for POIs (schools, gyms, grocery stores, etc.)
4. **Multi-Modal Search**: Combines text, images, and location in a single query
