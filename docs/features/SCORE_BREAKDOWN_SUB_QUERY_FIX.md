# Score Breakdown - Sub-Query Display Fix

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## Issues Reported

1. ❌ **Matched Sub-Query showing "N/A"** for each image in multi-query mode
2. ❌ **Missing section showing original query and sub-query split**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Sub-Query Data Not Returned

**Problem:** Backend wasn't returning `debug_info` in the response

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "results": [...],
  "debug_info": null  // ← Missing!
}
```

**Root Cause:** Response builder didn't include `debug_info` even when `sub_query_data` was available

---

### Issue #2: Image Scores Missing Sub-Query Attribution

**Problem:** `individual_image_scores` didn't include which sub-query matched each image

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "individual_image_scores": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "url": "...",
      "score": 0.702
      // Missing: sub_query_index, sub_query_feature
    }
  ]
}
```

**Root Cause:** The detailed scoring function `calculate_multi_query_image_score_detailed` was created but image URLs weren't being extracted correctly from property data

---

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Add debug_info to Response

**File:** [search.py:1939-1951](search.py#L1939-L1951)

**Added:**
```python
# Include debug info for multi-query mode
if sub_query_data:
    response_data["debug_info"] = {
        "sub_queries": sub_query_data.get("sub_queries", []),
        "query": {
            "original": q,
            "extracted_constraints": {
                "must_tags": list(must_tags),
                "query_type": query_type,
                "architecture_style": architecture_style
            }
        }
    }
```

**Result:** Response now includes:
- Original query text
- Extracted constraints (must_tags, query_type, architecture_style)
- All generated sub-queries with weights, features, and search strategies

---

### Fix #2: Improve Image URL Extraction

**File:** [search.py:891-911](search.py#L891-L911)

**Problem:** Only checked `responsivePhotos`, which isn't always present in `src`

**Before:**
```python
# Get image URLs from responsivePhotos
image_urls = []
responsive_photos = property_data.get("responsivePhotos", [])
for photo in responsive_photos:
    url = photo.get("mixedSources", {}).get("jpeg", [{}])[0].get("url", "")
    image_urls.append(url)
```

**After:**
```python
# Get image URLs from multiple possible sources
image_urls = []

# Try responsivePhotos first (full Zillow data)
responsive_photos = property_data.get("responsivePhotos", [])
if responsive_photos:
    for photo in responsive_photos:
        url = photo.get("mixedSources", {}).get("jpeg", [{}])[0].get("url", "")
        if url:
            image_urls.append(url)

# Fall back to images array
if not image_urls:
    image_urls = property_data.get("images", [])

# Last resort: try to get from image_vectors
if not image_urls and "image_vectors" in property_data:
    for img_vec_obj in property_data["image_vectors"]:
        url = img_vec_obj.get("image_url", "")
        if url:
            image_urls.append(url)
```

**Result:** Now successfully extracts image URLs from any of the available data sources

---

## What Now Works

### 1. Query Split Section Displays ✅

When viewing score breakdown in multi-query mode, you now see:

```
🔀 Multi-Query Splitting Results

Original Query:
"White houses with granite countertops and wood floors"

⬇️ Split into 3 context-specific sub-queries:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sub-query #1: "granite countertops"            │
│ Feature: granite_countertops                    │
│ Weight: 1x | Strategy: max                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sub-query #2: "white exterior"                 │
│ Feature: white_exterior                         │
│ Weight: 1x | Strategy: max                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sub-query #3: "hardwood floors"                │
│ Feature: hardwood_floors                        │
│ Weight: 1x | Strategy: max                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 2. Matched Sub-Query Shows Feature Info ✅

In the "Individual Image Vector Scores" table, the "Matched Sub-Query" column now shows:

**Before:**
```
N/A
```

**After:**
```
Sub-query #1
Feature: granite_countertops
"granite countertops"
```

**Full Data Displayed:**
- Sub-query number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Feature name (e.g., `granite_countertops`)
- Actual query text (e.g., "granite countertops")

---

            "sub_query_index": 0,
            "sub_query_feature": "granite_countertops"
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

✅ **All data present!**

---

## UI Display Flow

### When User Clicks "View Detailed Score Breakdown"

1. **UI makes new search request** with `include_scoring_details=true`
2. **Backend returns full response** with `debug_info` and detailed `individual_image_scores`
3. **UI checks for multi-query mode:** `if (currentMode === 'multi' && searchData.debug_info?.sub_queries)`
4. **Renders query split section** showing original query → sub-queries
5. **Renders individual image scores table** with matched sub-query column
6. **For each image:** Shows which sub-query matched it with feature name and query text

---

## Files Modified

### Backend

1. **[search.py:1939-1951](search.py#L1939-L1951)**
   - Added `debug_info` to response when `sub_query_data` exists
   - Includes original query, extracted constraints, and sub-queries

2. **[search.py:891-911](search.py#L891-L911)**
   - Enhanced image URL extraction in `calculate_multi_query_image_score_detailed`
   - Tries responsivePhotos → images → image_vectors.image_url
   - Ensures image URLs are available for all properties

### Frontend

**No changes needed!** ✅

The UI code at [multi_query_comparison.html:1008-1070](ui/multi_query_comparison.html#L1008-L1070) already had the query split section. It was just waiting for the backend to send `debug_info`.

The sub-query display code at [multi_query_comparison.html:1347-1358](ui/multi_query_comparison.html#L1347-L1358) was also already correct.

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Full transparency** - See how query was split
2. **Feature attribution** - Know which sub-query matched each image
3. **Better understanding** - Understand multi-query mode scoring
4. **Visual feedback** - See query text and feature names

### For Debugging
1. **Verify splitting logic** - Check if query split correctly
2. **Validate weights** - See if important features weighted higher
3. **Trace matches** - Follow which features matched which images
4. **Identify issues** - Spot if wrong features extracted

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Behavior

**Only showing top image per property in some cases**

**Logs show:**
```
Computed 1 multi-query individual image scores for zpid=2080387168
```

**Why:** The `calculate_multi_query_image_score_detailed` function only processes images that are in `inner_hits` from OpenSearch. If OpenSearch only returned 1 image in inner_hits (due to pagination/size limits), we only get 1 image score.

**Impact:** Minor - user still sees the matched sub-query for the images that are returned. The missing images are typically lower-scoring and less relevant.

**Future Fix:** Could retrieve all image vectors from `src.image_vectors` and score them manually against all sub-queries. This would give scores for ALL images, not just the ones OpenSearch returned in inner_hits.
