## Example Analysis Session

```bash
# User just made a search and got poor results
$ curl -X POST https://ectmd6vfzh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/search \
  -d '{"q": "Modern homes with granite countertops", "size": 5, "index": "listings-v2"}' \
  | jq -r '.query_id'

c2e9602c-c173-472d-95bd-b6f861aba910

# User asks: "Can you analyze that search?"
# Assistant runs:
$ python analyze_search.py --query-id c2e9602c-c173-472d-95bd-b6f861aba910

# Result: Complete detailed analysis showing:
# - 54% of time spent in constraint extraction (optimization target!)
# - Zero feature matches (feature_tags empty - known bug)
# - Poor strategy consensus (0% overlap)
# - Specific zpids returned with scores

# Find similar issues:
$ python analyze_search.py --poor-quality --threshold 0.03

# Check if this is a pattern:
$ python analyze_search.py --stats
Performance Statistics:
  Average:       1867.57 ms
  95th %ile:     2075.57 ms

# Both searches show constraint_extraction_ms as bottleneck!
```

## Key Insights Discovered

### 1. Performance Bottleneck: Constraint Extraction
**Both test queries:** 54-68% of total time spent in constraint extraction!

- Query 1: 1137.33 ms (68.5%)
- Query 2: 1124.90 ms (54.2%)

**Root Cause:** Likely the regex/parsing in `extract_query_constraints()`

**Recommendation:** Profile and optimize constraint extraction logic.

---

### 2. Feature Matching Completely Broken
**Zero feature matches** despite:
- Constraints correctly extracted: `['modern', 'granite_countertops']`
- feature_tags field exists in schema
- image_tags field populated

**Root Cause:** feature_tags field empty for all properties

**Impact:** Tag boosting cannot work, quality severely degraded

**Recommendation:** Investigate data pipeline - why is feature_tags empty?

---

### 3. Strategy Divergence
**Zero overlap** between BM25, kNN text, and kNN image in both queries.

**Observations:**
- BM25 ∩ Text kNN: 0-1 properties
- BM25 ∩ Image kNN: 0 properties
- Text ∩ Image kNN: 0 properties
- All Three: 0 properties

**Implications:**
- RRF is doing fusion, but strategies are finding completely different properties
- This could mean: (a) strategies are too divergent, or (b) result pool is so large that overlap is naturally low

**Recommendation:** Analyze top 20 results from each strategy to understand divergence.

---

## Interactive Analysis Workflow

### Scenario 1: User Reports Poor Results

**User:** "I searched for 'Modern homes with granite countertops' and got terrible results."

**Assistant:**
1. Gets query_id from user's response JSON
2. Runs: `python analyze_search.py --query-id <id>`
3. Identifies:
   - Quality: POOR - No feature matches
   - Warning: feature_tags empty for 5/5 results
   - 0% strategy overlap
4. Explains: "The feature_tags field is empty, so tag boosting can't work. This is a data pipeline issue."

---

### Scenario 2: System Slow

**User:** "Searches are taking forever lately."

**Assistant:**
1. Runs: `python analyze_search.py --stats`
2. Sees: p95: 2075ms, avg: 1867ms
3. Runs: `python analyze_search.py --slow --threshold 1000 --details`
4. Identifies: constraint_extraction_ms is 54-68% of total time
5. Recommends: "Profile extract_query_constraints() - it's taking 1+ second"

---

### Scenario 3: Compare Before/After

**User:** "I changed the boost_mode. Did it help?"

**Assistant:**
1. Runs: `python analyze_search.py --text "Modern homes" --limit 5`
2. Gets two query_ids (before and after change)
3. Runs: `python analyze_search.py --compare <id1> <id2>`
4. Shows: Score delta, timing delta, quality differences

## Usage Guide

### For User to Analyze Their Own Searches

**Step 1: Make a search**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ectmd6vfzh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"q": "Your query here", "size": 10, "index": "listings-v2"}' \
  | jq '.query_id'
```

**Step 2: Analyze it**
```bash
python analyze_search.py --query-id <query-id-from-step-1>
```

**Step 3: Deep dive**
```bash
# Find similar poor quality searches
python analyze_search.py --poor-quality --threshold 0.03

# Check if it's slow
python analyze_search.py --slow --threshold 2000

# See overall performance
python analyze_search.py --stats
```

---

### For Developer Troubleshooting

**Check recent activity:**
```bash
python analyze_search.py --recent --limit 20
```

**Find errors:**
```bash
python analyze_search.py --errors --details
```

**Performance analysis:**
```bash
# Get stats
python analyze_search.py --stats

# Find slow queries
python analyze_search.py --slow --threshold 3000 --details
```

**Quality investigation:**
```bash
# Find poor quality
python analyze_search.py --poor-quality --threshold 0.02 --details

# Compare two versions
python analyze_search.py --compare old-query-id new-query-id
```

---

### For Data Science / ML

**Export data for analysis:**
```python
from search_log_reader import get_recent_searches
import json

# Get last 1000 searches
searches = get_recent_searches(1000)

# Export to JSON for pandas/analysis
with open('searches.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(searches, f, indent=2)
```

**Build training data:**
```python
# Collect queries with feature matches for ML training
from search_log_reader import find_poor_quality_searches

poor = find_poor_quality_searches(max_avg_score=0.03, limit=500)

# Extract (query, constraints, results, quality_metrics) tuples
training_data = [
    {
        'query': s['query_text'],
        'constraints': s['extracted_constraints'],
        'results': s['results'],
        'avg_score': s['result_quality_metrics']['avg_score'],
        'overlap': s['result_overlap']
    }
    for s in poor
]
```
