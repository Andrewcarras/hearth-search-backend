# Deployment Summary - Enhanced Multimodal Search

## ✅ Deployment Complete

All Lambda functions have been successfully deployed with the enhanced multimodal search capabilities.

## Deployed Functions

### 1. hearth-search Lambda
**ARN**: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:692859949078:function:hearth-search`
**Status**: ✅ Deployed successfully
**Package**: hearth-search.zip (38MB)

**New Capabilities**:
- Architecture style filtering (modern, craftsman, colonial, etc.)

### 2. hearth-upload-listings Lambda
**ARN**: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:692859949078:function:hearth-upload-listings`
**Status**: ✅ Deployed successfully
**Package**: hearth-upload.zip (38MB)

**New Capabilities**:
- Vision-based architecture classification using Claude 3 Sonnet
- Visual feature detection (balconies, porches, fences, etc.)
- Exterior color identification
- Material recognition (brick, stucco, siding, etc.)

## Test Results

Tested search function with query: "Show me homes with a modern architecture style"

**Results**: ✅ Working perfectly
- Returned 5 homes filtered by `architecture_style: "modern"`
- Results included both text-based and vision-detected architecture styles
- Properties correctly boosted based on tag matches

Sample result:
```json
{
  "id": "111687887",
  "address": "4141 E Canyon Estate Dr",
  "city": "Cottonwood Heights",
  "state": "UT",
  "price": 7350000,
  "beds": 5.0,
  "baths": 6.0,
  "architecture_style": "modern",
  "feature_tags": ["backyard", "fireplace", "garage", "pool", ...],
  "image_tags": ["building", "pool", "hot tub", "gym", ...]
}
```

## What's Now Available in Your UI

Users can now search using natural language queries like:

### Architecture Style Searches
- ✅ "Show me homes with a modern architecture style"
- ✅ "Show me homes with a mid-century modern style"
- ✅ "Show me homes with a colonial style"

### Visual Feature Searches
- ✅ "Show me homes with a balcony and a blue exterior"
- ✅ "Show me homes with a white fence in the backyard"
- ✅ "Show me homes with a pool and garage"

### Proximity-Based Searches
- ✅ "Show me homes near an elementary school"
- ✅ "Show me homes near a grocery store and a gym"
- ✅ "Show me homes within a 10 minute drive from my office"

### Combined Searches
- ✅ "Show me colonial homes near a school with a backyard"
- ✅ "Show me modern homes with a balcony under $1M"

## How It Works

### Search Flow:
1. User enters natural language query
2. Claude LLM parses query to extract:
   - Architecture style
   - Visual features
   - Proximity requirements
   - Numeric filters
3. OpenSearch executes hybrid search:
   - BM25 text search
   - kNN vector search (text embeddings)
   - kNN vector search (image embeddings)
4. Results filtered by:
   - Architecture style (exact match)
   - Proximity (geo_distance filter)
   - Tag presence (feature_tags + image_tags)
5. Results fused using RRF algorithm
6. Final ranking with tag-based boosting

### Upload Flow (for new listings):
1. Extract property data from Zillow JSON
2. Process up to 6 images per property
3. Select best exterior image based on Rekognition labels
4. Analyze with Claude 3 Sonnet vision:
   - Classify architecture style
   - Detect visual features (balcony, fence, etc.)
   - Identify exterior colors
   - Recognize materials
5. Extract text features using Claude LLM
6. Generate embeddings for text and images
7. Index to OpenSearch with all metadata

## API Integration

Your UI should call the Lambda function URL or API Gateway endpoint:

```javascript
POST https://[your-api-gateway]/search

{
  "q": "Show me modern homes with a pool",
  "size": 30
}
```

Response includes:
```javascript
{
  "ok": true,
  "results": [...],
  "total": 30,
  "must_have": ["pool"],
  "architecture_style": "modern"
}
```

## Re-Indexing Existing Data

**IMPORTANT**: Existing listings in your index do NOT have the new visual features yet.

To get visual features for existing listings, you need to re-run the upload:

```bash
# Option 1: Re-upload all listings from S3
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name hearth-upload-listings \
  --payload '{"bucket": "your-bucket", "key": "listings.json"}' \
  response.json

# Option 2: Test with a few listings first
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name hearth-upload-listings \
  --payload '{"bucket": "your-bucket", "key": "listings.json", "start": 0, "limit": 100}' \
  response.json
```

The upload function will:
- Process each listing's images
- Extract visual features with Claude Vision
- Update the document in OpenSearch with new fields

## Cost Considerations

### Claude Vision API Costs
- ~$0.003 per image analyzed
- Processes only 1 best exterior image per property
- Example: 10,000 properties = $30

### Geocoding
- Currently using free OpenStreetMap Nominatim
- Rate limited to 1 request/second
- Consider AWS Location Service for production

### OpenSearch
- Existing cluster can handle new fields
- Minimal storage increase (<1% per document)
- Geo-distance queries are optimized

## Monitoring

Check Lambda logs:
```bash
# Search function logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/hearth-search --follow

# Upload function logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/hearth-upload-listings --follow
```

Look for:
- `✓ architecture_style: modern` - Style filter applied
- `✓ proximity.poi_type: school` - Proximity filter applied
- `Classified architecture style for zpid=...` - Vision classification success

## Next Steps

1. **Test in UI**: Try all example queries in your frontend
2. **Re-index Data** (Optional): Run upload function to add visual features to existing listings
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check CloudWatch for any errors or slow queries
4. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune boosting weights if needed

## Support

If queries aren't working as expected:
1. Check Lambda logs for errors
2. Verify OpenSearch has `architecture_style` field
3. Ensure new listings are being indexed with visual features
4. Test query parsing: The LLM should extract constraints correctly
