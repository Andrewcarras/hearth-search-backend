# Query Expansion & Rewriting Research for Real Estate Search

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Context:** Improving search recall for queries like "white houses with wood floors" without reindexing
**Current Problem:** LLM extracts "white_exterior", "hardwood_floors" but image tags have "white_exterior" on brown houses (from interior white walls)

---

## Executive Summary

This research explores **runtime query modification techniques** to improve search recall without changing the index schema. The focus is on techniques applicable to real estate multimodal search (text + images) where:

1. User queries are natural language ("white houses with wood floors")
2. LLM extracts structured features ("white_exterior", "hardwood_floors")
3. Index contains noisy/ambiguous tags (e.g., "white_exterior" on non-white houses)
4. Need to balance precision (correct matches) with recall (finding all relevant results)

**Key Findings:**
- **Multi-Query Rewriting** shows 14.46% precision improvement (DMQR-RAG, 2024)
- **Constraint Relaxation** (must-have → nice-to-have) significantly improves recall
- **Query Decomposition** helps complex multi-attribute queries
- **Semantic Expansion** via hypernyms/hyponyms works well for visual features
- **Context-aware synonyms** are critical for real estate (e.g., "white house" ≠ "White House")

## 1. Query Expansion Techniques

### 1.1 Synonym and Semantic Expansion

**Definition:** Augment the query with synonyms, related terms, hypernyms (broader concepts), and hyponyms (narrower concepts).

#### Academic Foundation
- **Classic IR (Stanford NLP)**: Query expansion using thesaurus-based approaches
  - Manual thesaurus: Human-curated synonym sets
  - Automatic thesaurus: Co-occurrence statistics from document collections
  - Query log mining: User reformulations as synonym sources

- **WordNet Integration**: Lexical database with semantic relationships
  - Hypernyms: "house" → "building" → "structure"
  - Hyponyms: "house" → "cottage", "bungalow", "ranch"
  - Meronyms: "house" → "roof", "walls", "foundation"
  - Holonyms: "kitchen" → "house"

#### Real Estate Application

**Feature Synonyms:**
```python
FEATURE_SYNONYMS = {
    # Exterior Colors (HIGH AMBIGUITY - use carefully)
    'white_exterior': ['white_house', 'white_siding', 'white_facade', 'painted_white'],
    'gray_exterior': ['grey_exterior', 'silver_exterior', 'gray_house'],

    # Materials (GOOD EXPANSION CANDIDATES)
    'hardwood_floors': ['wood_floors', 'hardwood_flooring', 'oak_floors',
                        'maple_floors', 'engineered_hardwood'],
    'granite_countertops': ['granite_counters', 'granite_kitchen', 'stone_countertops'],
    'brick_exterior': ['brick_house', 'brick_facade', 'brick_siding', 'red_brick'],

    # Architecture Styles (SEMANTIC HIERARCHY)
    'modern': ['contemporary', 'minimalist', 'sleek_design', 'clean_lines'],
    'craftsman': ['bungalow', 'arts_and_crafts', 'artisan_style'],
    'mid_century_modern': ['mid-century', 'mcm', 'retro_modern', '1950s_style'],

    # Amenities (STANDARDIZE VARIATIONS)
    'pool': ['swimming_pool', 'in-ground_pool', 'outdoor_pool', 'heated_pool'],
    'garage': ['attached_garage', '2_car_garage', 'parking', 'covered_parking'],
    'fireplace': ['wood_fireplace', 'gas_fireplace', 'stone_fireplace'],
}

# Hypernym/Hyponym Hierarchies
FEATURE_HIERARCHY = {
    'flooring': {  # Hypernym
        'hardwood': ['oak', 'maple', 'cherry', 'walnut', 'engineered'],  # Hyponyms
        'tile': ['ceramic', 'porcelain', 'marble', 'travertine'],
        'carpet': ['plush', 'berber', 'frieze', 'saxony']
    },
    'countertop': {
        'stone': ['granite', 'marble', 'quartzite', 'soapstone'],
        'engineered': ['quartz', 'caesarstone', 'silestone'],
        'other': ['butcher_block', 'concrete', 'laminate']
    },
    'exterior_material': {
        'masonry': ['brick', 'stone', 'stucco', 'concrete'],
        'siding': ['vinyl', 'wood', 'fiber_cement', 'metal'],
        'composite': ['engineered_wood', 'composite_siding']
    }
}
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
def expand_query_with_synonyms(query_features, synonym_dict, max_expansions=3):
    """
    Expand query features with synonyms, ranked by specificity.

    Strategy:
    1. Keep original feature (highest priority)
    2. Add exact synonyms (same specificity)
    3. Add hypernyms (broader - improves recall)
    4. Optionally add hyponyms (narrower - may reduce recall)

    Example:
    Input: ["hardwood_floors"]
    Output: ["hardwood_floors", "wood_floors", "oak_floors", "maple_floors"]
    """
    expanded = set(query_features)  # Original features

    for feature in query_features:
        if feature in synonym_dict:
            synonyms = synonym_dict[feature][:max_expansions]
            expanded.update(synonyms)

    return list(expanded)

# For OpenSearch query
expanded_features = expand_query_with_synonyms(
    query_features=['hardwood_floors', 'white_exterior'],
    synonym_dict=FEATURE_SYNONYMS,
    max_expansions=3
)

# Use in BM25 query
{
    "bool": {
        "should": [
            {"terms": {"feature_tags": expanded_features, "boost": 2.0}},
            {"terms": {"image_tags": expanded_features, "boost": 1.5}},
            {"match": {"visual_features_text": " ".join(expanded_features)}}
        ],
        "minimum_should_match": 1
    }
}
```

**Risks and Mitigations:**

| Risk | Example | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Over-expansion** | "white house" → "White House" (government building) | Context-aware filtering, real estate domain constraints |
| **Ambiguity** | "modern" → too many interpretations | Use visual embeddings to disambiguate |
| **Tag noise** | "white_exterior" tags on brown houses | Weight expansion lower than original, use image verification |
| **Performance** | Expanding 10 features → 40 terms | Limit expansions per feature (max 3-5), use caching |

**E-commerce Insights (2024):**
- **Context-aware expansion**: "affordable" → "budget-friendly" but NOT "cheap" (negative connotation)
- **Attribute-specific synonyms**: Color synonyms differ from material synonyms
- **ML-based filtering**: Train classifier to filter bad synonym expansions using user click data

---

### 1.2 Contextual and Visual Expansion

**Concept:** Expand queries based on visual similarity and contextual understanding, not just text synonyms.

#### Visual Query Expansion for Real Estate

**Problem:** Text synonyms alone miss visual similarity:
- "Craftsman style" homes may not have "craftsman" in description
- "White house" images exist but tags say "beige" or "cream"
- "Modern kitchen" has visual characteristics beyond words

**Solution:** Generate pseudo-queries from visual embeddings

```python
def generate_visual_expansion_queries(query_embedding, top_k=5):
    """
    Generate expansion terms by finding visually similar listings
    and extracting their common features.

    Process:
    1. Find top K visually similar listings using kNN on image embeddings
    2. Extract frequent feature tags from those listings
    3. Use as query expansion candidates

    Example:
    Query: "white houses"
    Visual matches: [house1, house2, house3] (all white exteriors)
    Common tags: ["white_siding", "painted_exterior", "light_colored", "colonial_style"]
    Expansion: Original query + ["white_siding", "light_colored"]
    """
    # Find visually similar properties
    similar_listings = knn_search(
        index="listings-v2",
        field="image_vectors.vector",
        query_vector=query_embedding,
        k=top_k,
        filter={"price": {"gt": 0}}  # Valid listings only
    )

    # Extract and count feature tags
    tag_freq = defaultdict(int)
    for listing in similar_listings:
        for tag in listing['feature_tags'] + listing['image_tags']:
            tag_freq[tag] += 1

    # Return tags appearing in majority of results
    threshold = top_k * 0.6  # 60% threshold
    expansion_tags = [tag for tag, count in tag_freq.items() if count >= threshold]

    return expansion_tags

# Usage in search
query_vec = embed_text_multimodal("white houses with wood floors")
visual_expansions = generate_visual_expansion_queries(query_vec, top_k=10)

# Combine with original query
final_features = original_features + visual_expansions
```

**Advantages:**
- Discovers visual patterns LLM might miss
- Works even when descriptions are poor
- Leverages existing good matches to find more

**Challenges:**
- Requires initial kNN search (adds latency ~200ms)
- Can amplify existing biases (if top results are wrong, expansion makes it worse)
- May drift from user intent if visual similarity doesn't match semantic intent

**Research Evidence:**
- **Conceptual + Visual Similarity (Springer, 2011)**: Combining conceptual query expansion with visual search result exploration significantly improves web image retrieval
- **Multimodal BGE (2024)**: Joint text+image embeddings enable cross-modal expansion

---

### 1.3 LLM-Based Query Rewriting

**Definition:** Use LLMs to generate alternative phrasings of the query, then search for all variations.

#### State-of-the-Art (2024 Research)

**DMQR-RAG (Diverse Multi-Query Rewriting):**
- Generates 4 different query types at different information levels
- Achieves **14.46% precision improvement** on FreshQA dataset
- Retrieves diverse documents by varying query specificity

**Four Rewriting Strategies:**

1. **Simplification:** Strip complex constraints
   - Original: "3 bedroom white house with pool under $500k"
   - Simplified: "white house with pool"
   - Purpose: Increase recall, find properties that match core features

2. **Decomposition:** Break into subqueries
   - Original: "white houses with wood floors"
   - Decomposed:
     - "white exterior homes"
     - "properties with hardwood flooring"
   - Purpose: Each subquery retrieves different aspects, combine results

3. **Specification:** Add more specific details
   - Original: "modern house"
   - Specified: "contemporary single-family home with clean lines and open floor plan"
   - Purpose: Increase precision for specific user intent

4. **Perspective Shift:** Rephrase from different angles
   - Original: "white house with wood floors"
   - Perspectives:
     - Buyer view: "move-in ready white home with updated flooring"
     - Investor view: "well-maintained property with desirable finishes"
     - Inspector view: "white exterior with hardwood floor installation"
   - Purpose: Match different description styles in index

#### Implementation for Real Estate

```python
def llm_query_rewriting(original_query, strategies=['simplify', 'decompose', 'specify']):
    """
    Generate multiple query variations using Claude/GPT.

    Args:
        original_query: User's natural language query

    Returns:
        List of rewritten queries
    """
    prompt = f"""
You are a real estate search expert. Rewrite this property search query in multiple ways
to improve search recall without losing the user's intent.

Original Query: "{original_query}"

Generate the following variations:

1. SIMPLIFIED (remove optional constraints, keep core features):
   - Purpose: Cast wider net to find more potential matches
   - Example: "3 bed 2 bath white house under $500k" → "white house"

2. DECOMPOSED (split into independent subqueries):
   - Purpose: Search for each feature separately, combine results
   - Example: "white house with pool" → ["white exterior home", "property with swimming pool"]

3. SPECIFIED (add typical associated features):
   - Purpose: Add common features that users might expect but didn't mention
   - Example: "modern house" → "modern home with open floor plan and natural light"

4. SYNONYM-EXPANDED (use alternative terms):
   - Purpose: Match different description styles
   - Example: "wood floors" → "hardwood flooring OR engineered wood OR oak floors"

| **3 variations (parallel)** | ~600ms | +10-15% recall | $0.004 |
| **5 variations (parallel)** | ~700ms | +20% recall | $0.006 |
| **Sequential (no parallel)** | ~2500ms | Same quality | Same cost |

**Recommendation:** Use 3 variations (original + simplified + decomposed) in parallel for optimal quality/latency tradeoff.

## 2. Constraint Relaxation Strategies

### 2.1 Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have Classification

**Concept:** Distinguish between hard requirements and soft preferences, progressively relax soft constraints if results are insufficient.

#### Theoretical Foundation (CSP Research)

From constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) literature:
- **Hard Constraints**: Cannot be violated (e.g., "under $500k", "3+ bedrooms")
- **Soft Constraints**: Can be violated with penalty (e.g., "prefer white exterior", "would like pool")
- **Weighted Constraints**: Assign importance weights, optimize satisfaction

**Flexible CSP Approach:**
- Partial relaxation of constraints when no exact matches exist
- Maximize satisfaction of high-priority constraints
- Minimize violations of lower-priority constraints

#### Real Estate Application

**Constraint Classification:**

```python
# Hard constraints (NEVER relax)
HARD_CONSTRAINT_KEYWORDS = {
    'price': ['under', 'maximum', 'budget', 'afford'],
    'location': ['must be in', 'only in', 'within X miles of'],
    'bedrooms': ['exactly', 'minimum', 'at least'],
    'legal': ['no HOA', 'fee simple', 'zoned for']
}

# Soft constraints (can relax)
SOFT_CONSTRAINT_KEYWORDS = {
    'preferences': ['prefer', 'would like', 'nice to have', 'ideally'],
    'amenities': ['pool', 'garage', 'fireplace'],  # Unless explicitly "must have"
    'style': ['modern', 'craftsman', 'contemporary'],
    'features': ['hardwood floors', 'granite counters', 'updated kitchen']
}

def classify_constraints(query_constraints):
    """

    """
    hard = []
    soft = []

    # Hard filters (from LLM extraction)
    if 'price_max' in query_constraints:

**Progressive Relaxation Strategy:**

```python
def progressive_search_with_relaxation(query, constraints, min_results=5, max_relaxations=3):

    else:
        return f"Found results that may not have: {', '.join(feature_names)}"

**Example Execution:**

```
Query: "white houses with pool and hardwood floors under $500k"

Constraints:
  Hard: [price ≤ $500k]
  Soft: [white_exterior (weight=0.8), pool (weight=0.7), hardwood_floors (weight=0.6)]

Round 0: All constraints
  Filters: price ≤ $500k AND white_exterior AND pool AND hardwood_floors
  Results: 2 (insufficient)

Round 1: Relax "hardwood_floors" (lowest weight)
  Filters: price ≤ $500k AND white_exterior AND pool
  Results: 7 (sufficient!)

Output to user:
  "Found 7 white houses with pools under $500k. Some may not have hardwood floors."
  [Show results with hardwood matches ranked higher]
```

**Benefits:**
- Guarantees results even for very specific queries
- User understands what was relaxed (transparency)
- Most important features still satisfied
- Automatic fallback without manual query refinement

**Challenges:**
- How to weight features (manual tuning vs. learned)
- When to stop relaxing (avoid showing irrelevant results)
- UI complexity (explaining relaxations)

### 2.2 Tiered Scoring with Partial Match Boosting

**Concept:** Instead of binary matching (has feature or doesn't), score properties based on how many features they match.

```python
def tiered_feature_matching(property_tags, required_features, nice_to_have_features):
    """
    Score property based on feature match percentage.

    Scoring tiers:
    - 100% required: 2.0x boost
    - 75-99% required: 1.5x boost
    - 50-74% required: 1.2x boost
    - <50% required: 1.0x (no boost)

    Nice-to-have features add additional +0.1x per match (max +0.5x)
    """
    required_matched = sum(1 for f in required_features if f in property_tags)
    required_ratio = required_matched / len(required_features) if required_features else 1.0

    nice_matched = sum(1 for f in nice_to_have_features if f in property_tags)
    nice_bonus = min(0.5, nice_matched * 0.1)

    # Tiered boost based on required feature match
    if required_ratio >= 1.0:
        boost = 2.0
    elif required_ratio >= 0.75:
        boost = 1.5
    elif required_ratio >= 0.5:
        boost = 1.2
    else:
        boost = 1.0

    # Add nice-to-have bonus
    final_boost = boost + nice_bonus

    return {
        'boost': final_boost,
        'required_ratio': required_ratio,
        'nice_matched': nice_matched,
        'explanation': f"{required_matched}/{len(required_features)} required, {nice_matched} nice-to-have"
    }

# Apply in post-RRF boosting
for listing in search_results:
    match_info = tiered_feature_matching(
        property_tags=listing['feature_tags'] + listing['image_tags'],
        required_features=must_have_tags,
        nice_to_have_features=nice_to_have_tags
    )

    listing['score'] *= match_info['boost']
    listing['match_explanation'] = match_info['explanation']
```

**Advantages:**
- Graceful degradation (partial matches still rank reasonably)
- Users see why each property ranked where it did
- More results in the pool (not filtered out by strict ANDing)

**Considerations:**
- Need to tune boost multipliers per domain
- May rank "2/3 features" higher than "1/1 features" if RRF score differs
- Requires clear UI to show match percentages

## 3. Query Decomposition and Multi-Query Strategies

### 3.1 Decomposition for Complex Queries

**Research Evidence (2024):**
- Decomposing complex queries into well-structured subqueries leads to more efficient retrieval
- Each subquery retrieves different information, synthesis provides comprehensive results
- Benefits: Enhanced precision/recall, improved handling of multi-part queries, parallel processing

**Real Estate Application:**

```python
def decompose_property_query(query):
    """
    Split complex query into independent subqueries.

    Example:
    Input: "white mid-century modern house with pool and hardwood floors"

    Output:
    [
        {
            'aspect': 'exterior',
            'query': 'white mid-century modern house',
            'features': ['white_exterior', 'mid_century_modern'],
            'weight': 1.0  # Highest weight - primary visual aspect

**When to Use Decomposition:**

| Query Type | Decompose? | Reason |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Simple ("white house") | ❌ No | Single aspect, decomposition adds overhead |
| Two aspects ("white house with pool") | ⚠️ Maybe | Parallel search may help, but marginal benefit |
| Multi-aspect ("white modern house with pool and hardwood under $500k") | ✅ Yes | Different search strategies per aspect |
| Location + features ("white house near school") | ✅ Yes | Separate geo and feature searches |

### 3.2 Fusion Strategies for Multi-Query Results

**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) - Current Approach:**
```python
score(doc) = Σ_queries (1 / (k + rank_in_query))
```

**Weighted RRF - Improved:**
```python
score(doc) = Σ_queries (weight_query * 1 / (k + rank_in_query))
```

**Combinator Strategies:**

1. **Round-Robin (Equal Weight):**
   - Take top result from query1, then query2, then query3, repeat
   - Simple, ensures diversity
   - Doesn't account for relevance differences

2. **Borda Count (Rank Aggregation):**
   - Assign points based on position (top result = N points, next = N-1, etc.)
   - Sum points across queries
   - Better handles ties than RRF

3. **Score-Based Fusion:**
   - Normalize scores from each query to [0,1]
   - Weighted sum: `final_score = w1*score1 + w2*score2 + w3*score3`
   - Requires careful normalization (different scales)

4. **Hybrid (Current + Decomposed):**
   ```python
   final_score = 0.6 * rrf_original_query + 0.4 * rrf_decomposed_queries
   ```
   - Combines single-query coherence with multi-query recall
   - Recommended approach

**Implementation:**
```python
def hybrid_fusion(original_results, decomposed_results, alpha=0.6):
    """
    Combine results from original query and decomposed subqueries.

    Args:
        original_results: Results from single original query
        decomposed_results: Fused results from subqueries
        alpha: Weight for original query (0.6 = 60% original, 40% decomposed)
    """
    scores = {}
    doc_map = {}

    # Score from original query
    for rank, doc in enumerate(original_results, start=1):
        doc_id = doc['zpid']
        doc_map[doc_id] = doc
        scores[doc_id] = alpha * (1.0 / (60 + rank))

    # Score from decomposed queries
    for rank, doc in enumerate(decomposed_results, start=1):
        doc_id = doc['zpid']
        doc_map[doc_id] = doc
        scores[doc_id] = scores.get(doc_id, 0) + (1-alpha) * (1.0 / (60 + rank))

    # Sort by combined score
    ranked = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [doc_map[doc_id] for doc_id, score in ranked]
```

## 4. Real Estate Domain-Specific Patterns

### 4.1 Attribute Synonym Expansion (E-commerce Insights)

**2024 Best Practices from E-commerce:**

1. **Context-Aware Synonyms:**
   - "White house" (real estate) ≠ "White House" (government)
   - "Modern kitchen" (updated/renovated) ≠ "modern architecture" (mid-century style)

   ```python
   CONTEXTUAL_SYNONYMS = {
       'white_house': {
           'real_estate': ['white_exterior', 'white_siding', 'painted_white'],
           'government': []  # Explicitly exclude
       },
       'modern': {
           'architecture': ['contemporary', 'minimalist', 'mid_century_modern'],
           'kitchen': ['updated', 'renovated', 'new_appliances', 'stainless_steel']
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Attribute-Specific Expansion:**
   ```python
   # Colors: Expand to shades and intensities
   'white_exterior' → ['white', 'off_white', 'cream', 'ivory', 'eggshell', 'light_beige']

   # Materials: Expand to types and variations
   'hardwood_floors' → ['oak_floors', 'maple_floors', 'engineered_hardwood',
                        'laminate_wood', 'wood_flooring']

   # Styles: Expand to related and sub-styles
   'craftsman' → ['bungalow', 'arts_and_crafts', 'prairie_style', 'mission_style']
   ```

3. **ML-Based Synonym Filtering (Advanced):**
   - Generate candidate synonyms from co-occurrence data
   - Train binary classifier on human-judged relevance
   - Filter synonyms that actually improve results

   **Data Collection:**
   ```python
   # Track query reformulations
   user_searches = [
       ('white house', 'white exterior home'),  # User refined → synonyms
       ('hardwood floors', 'oak flooring'),     # User refined
       ('pool', 'swimming pool'),               # User refined
   ]

   # Track click-through patterns
   query_clicks = {
       'white house': {
           'clicked_listings': [123, 456, 789],  # zpids
           'common_tags': ['white_exterior', 'painted_white', 'light_colored']
       }
   }

   # Use for synonym generation
   def generate_synonyms_from_clicks(query, min_frequency=0.3):
       """
       Extract synonym candidates from tags of clicked listings.
       """
       clicks = query_clicks.get(query, {})
       clicked_listings = clicks.get('clicked_listings', [])

       if len(clicked_listings) < 10:
           return []  # Not enough data

       tag_freq = count_tags_in_listings(clicked_listings)
       threshold = len(clicked_listings) * min_frequency

       return [tag for tag, count in tag_freq.items() if count >= threshold]
   ```

### 4.2 Visual vs. Text Feature Classification

**Current Problem:** "white_exterior" tag on brown houses because interior has white walls

**Solution: Feature-Context Classification (from QUERY_CLASSIFICATION_ANALYSIS.md)**

```python
# Features best found via IMAGES (boost image search)
VISUAL_DOMINANT_FEATURES = {
    # Exterior colors - whole house appearance
    'white_exterior', 'gray_exterior', 'blue_exterior', 'brick_exterior',
    'stone_exterior', 'beige_exterior', 'brown_exterior',

    # Architecture styles - visual design
    'mid_century_modern', 'craftsman', 'contemporary', 'colonial',
    'ranch', 'victorian', 'mediterranean',

    # Outdoor structures - visible in photos
    'white_fence', 'stone_patio', 'brick_walkway', 'deck',
    'front_porch', 'covered_patio', 'pergola', 'balcony',

    # Environmental - surroundings
    'mountain_views', 'lake_views', 'ocean_views', 'wooded_lot',
}

# Features best found via TEXT/TAGS (boost BM25 search)
TEXT_DOMINANT_FEATURES = {
    # Interior specifics - rarely in main photos
    'granite_countertops', 'quartz_countertops', 'marble_countertops',
    'stainless_appliances', 'gas_range', 'double_oven',

    # Interior colors - specific mentions
    'blue_cabinets', 'white_cabinets', 'gray_cabinets',
    'pink_bathroom', 'colored_bathroom',

    # Room features - described not always visible
    'walk_in_closet', 'double_vanity', 'soaking_tub',
    'kitchen_island', 'breakfast_nook', 'pantry',

    # Systems - never visible
    'central_air', 'radiant_heat', 'heat_pump',
    'smart_home', 'security_system', 'solar_panels',
}

# Features work with BOTH (balanced scoring)
HYBRID_FEATURES = {
    # Flooring - visible and tagged
    'hardwood_floors', 'tile_floors', 'carpet', 'laminate',

    # Amenities - both visible and tagged
    'pool', 'swimming_pool', 'garage', 'fireplace',
    'hot_tub', 'spa',

    # Space features - both visual and descriptive
    'open_floorplan', 'vaulted_ceilings', 'high_ceilings',
    'large_yard', 'finished_basement',
}

def calculate_feature_based_weights(must_have_tags):
    """
    Calculate adaptive RRF k-values based on feature classification.

    Returns: [bm25_k, text_knn_k, image_knn_k]
    Lower k = higher weight
    """
    visual_count = sum(1 for tag in must_have_tags if tag in VISUAL_DOMINANT_FEATURES)
    text_count = sum(1 for tag in must_have_tags if tag in TEXT_DOMINANT_FEATURES)
    hybrid_count = sum(1 for tag in must_have_tags if tag in HYBRID_FEATURES)

    total = visual_count + text_count + hybrid_count
    if total == 0:
        return [60, 60, 60]  # Balanced

    visual_ratio = visual_count / total
    text_ratio = text_count / total

    # Determine weights based on feature distribution
    if visual_ratio >= 0.6:
        # Heavy visual: boost images significantly
        return [60, 50, 30]  # BM25=normal, Text=slight boost, Image=HIGH boost
    elif visual_ratio >= 0.4:
        # Balanced with visual tilt
        return [55, 55, 40]
    elif text_ratio >= 0.6:
        # Heavy text: boost BM25/text, de-emphasize images
        return [40, 50, 75]  # BM25=HIGH boost, Text=normal, Image=low
    elif text_ratio >= 0.4:
        # Balanced with text tilt
        return [45, 52, 65]
    else:
        # Mixed/hybrid dominated
        return [55, 55, 55]

# Usage
query = "white houses with wood floors"
features = extract_query_constraints(query)['must_have']  # ['white_exterior', 'hardwood_floors']

weights = calculate_feature_based_weights(features)
# white_exterior → VISUAL_DOMINANT (1 point)
# hardwood_floors → HYBRID (1 point)
# Result: 50% visual, 50% hybrid → Balanced with visual tilt: [55, 55, 40]
```

**Benefits:**
- Fixes "white house" ranking brown houses (boosts image search for exterior colors)
- Maintains good text search for interior specifics
- Self-documenting (feature lists show search behavior)
- Easy to tune (add features to appropriate list)

## 5. Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Feature-Context Classification (IMMEDIATE)
**Effort:** 2 hours | **Impact:** HIGH | **Risk:** LOW

Implement the feature classification approach from QUERY_CLASSIFICATION_ANALYSIS.md:

```python
# 1. Add feature dictionaries (30 min)
#    - Copy VISUAL_DOMINANT_FEATURES, TEXT_DOMINANT_FEATURES, HYBRID_FEATURES
#    - Place in common.py or search.py

# 2. Update calculate_adaptive_weights_v2() (1 hour)
#    - Replace keyword matching with feature lookup
#    - Implement ratio-based weighting
#    - Add logging

# 3. Test with problem queries (30 min)
#    - "white houses with wood floors" (should boost images now)
#    - "pink bathtub" (should boost images for color)
#    - "granite countertops" (should boost text/tags)
```

**Expected Results:**
- "white houses with wood floors": Brown house drops from #1, white houses rank higher
- Image k-value: 120 (de-boost) → 40 (boost) for exterior colors
- No reindexing required

---

### Priority 2: Simple Synonym Expansion (QUICK WIN)
**Effort:** 3 hours | **Impact:** MEDIUM | **Risk:** LOW

Add synonym expansion for top 20 most common features:

```python
# 1. Create synonym dictionary (1 hour)
FEATURE_SYNONYMS = {
    'hardwood_floors': ['wood_floors', 'hardwood_flooring', 'oak_floors'],
    'white_exterior': ['white_house', 'white_siding', 'painted_white'],
    'pool': ['swimming_pool', 'in-ground_pool', 'outdoor_pool'],
    # ... add 17 more
}

# 2. Add expansion function (1 hour)
def expand_query_features(features, max_per_feature=3):
    expanded = set(features)
    for feat in features:
        if feat in FEATURE_SYNONYMS:
            expanded.update(FEATURE_SYNONYMS[feat][:max_per_feature])
    return list(expanded)

# 3. Update BM25 query (30 min)
expanded_features = expand_query_features(must_have_tags)
# Use in terms queries with slightly lower boost

# 4. Test and tune (30 min)
```

**Expected Results:**
- 10-15% recall improvement on feature queries
- Better matches when users use different terminology
- Minimal precision loss (synonyms are carefully curated)

---

### Priority 3: Constraint Relaxation UI (MEDIUM EFFORT)
**Effort:** 4 hours | **Impact:** MEDIUM | **Risk:** MEDIUM

Implement progressive relaxation with user feedback:

```python
# 1. Add constraint classification (1 hour)
#    - Classify features as must-have vs nice-to-have
#    - Weight by explicit keywords ("must have", "prefer")

# 2. Implement progressive search (2 hours)
#    - Search with all constraints
#    - If < 5 results, relax lowest-weight feature
#    - Track relaxations

# 3. Update UI to show relaxations (1 hour)
#    - "Found 12 results. Some may not have: pool, hardwood floors"
#    - Visual indicators on results showing which features match
```

**Expected Results:**
- Zero-result queries reduced by 60-80%
- Users understand why results don't exactly match
- Can manually re-tighten constraints if desired

---

### Priority 4: Multi-Query Rewriting (ADVANCED)
**Effort:** 8 hours | **Impact:** HIGH | **Risk:** MEDIUM-HIGH

Implement LLM-based query rewriting with parallel search:

```python
# 1. LLM rewriting function (2 hours)
#    - Simplification, decomposition, specification
#    - Prompt engineering and testing

# 2. Parallel search execution (3 hours)
#    - Execute 3-5 query variations in parallel
#    - Weighted RRF fusion
#    - Latency optimization

# 3. Caching layer (2 hours)
#    - Cache LLM rewritings (query → variations)
#    - Cache search results per variation
#    - DynamoDB TTL: 1 hour

# 4. A/B testing framework (1 hour)
#    - Compare multi-query vs single-query
#    - Track precision, recall, latency
```

**Expected Results:**
- 15-20% precision improvement (based on DMQR-RAG research)
- 10-15% recall improvement
- Latency: +100ms (with caching), +500ms (without)
- Cost: +$0.003 per search (LLM rewriting)

---

### Priority 5: Visual Query Expansion (EXPERIMENTAL)
**Effort:** 6 hours | **Impact:** MEDIUM | **Risk:** HIGH

Use kNN results to expand query tags:

```python
# 1. Initial kNN search (2 hours)
#    - Find top 10 visually similar listings
#    - Extract frequent tags
#    - Add as query expansion

# 2. Feedback loop (3 hours)
#    - If expanded query yields good results, cache expansion
#    - If bad results, blacklist expansion for this query
#    - ML model to predict good expansions (future)

# 3. Testing (1 hour)
#    - Risk of query drift
#    - A/B test against baseline
```

**Expected Results:**
- Works well for visual queries ("white house", "modern kitchen")
- May not work for text-heavy queries ("granite countertops")
- Requires careful tuning to avoid drift

### A/B Testing Framework

```python
# Split traffic 50/50
def get_search_mode(user_id):
    """Assign user to control or treatment group."""
    if hash(user_id) % 2 == 0:
        return 'control'  # Current system
    else:
        return 'treatment'  # New query expansion

# Track metrics per group
METRICS = {
    'control': {
        'zero_results': 0,
        'avg_results': 0,
        'clicks': 0,
        'queries': 0
    },
    'treatment': { ... }
}

# Statistical significance test
# After 1000 queries per group, run t-test
def evaluate_ab_test():
    """
    Determine if treatment is significantly better.

    Metrics to compare:
    - Zero-result rate (lower is better)
    - Click-through rate (higher is better)
    - Average results (higher is better, up to ~50)
    - Time to first click (lower is better)
    """
    pass
```
